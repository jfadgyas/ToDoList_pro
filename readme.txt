version 1.0

Features:
1. add todos in the top field
2. add tags by clicking the + button (currently limited to 3 because of the design)
3. filter list by tags
4. if you add a new item while filtering, new todo gets the actual tag
5. delete todo by clicking X button

Still need to do:
1. clean up messy css
2. remove tags by clicking them
3. tag design comes from js instead of hardwired css
